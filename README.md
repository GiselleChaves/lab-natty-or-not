Natural ou Fake Natty?

## 📒 Description
Activity proposed during the Generative AI course at Dio.me

## 🤖 Tecnologias Utilizadas
https://leonardo.ai

## 🧐 Creation Process
The main goal is to use generative AIs to create any type of content, aiming to make it as natural as possible.
Based on this, using the website Leonardo.ai, I created the image from the following prompt:

"I would like an image of a realistic dinosaur riding a bicycle on a busy street in New York in modern times. The dinosaur should be smaller and more integrated into the environment so that it is not the center of attention. It should be discreet and blend naturally into the surroundings."

## 🚀 Results
Four images were generated, and one was selected as the most natural.
